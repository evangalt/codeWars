| **P** | Parameters  | Define the input parameters that the function or method will accept. This helps in understanding what data types and values are expected by the function.                                              |
| **R** | Returns     | Specify the output or return value of the function. This clarifies what the function is expected to produce after processing the input parameters.                                                     |
| **E** | Examples    | Provide examples of how the function should be called and what results to expect. This can serve as a quick reference for other developers who want to use your function.                              |
| **P** | Pseudo-code | Write pseudo-code, which is a plain language description of the algorithm or logic behind the code. This helps in planning the implementation and makes it easier to translate into actual code later. |
